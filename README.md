# Useful Code

This repository contains a collection of short but useful code snippets, scripts, and utilities for various tasks. Each category of code is stored in a separate folder.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- `pdf_merger/` - A utility to merge multiple PDF files into one.
- `file_organizer/` - A script to sort files into folders based on their extensions.
- `qr_generator/` - A tool to generate QR codes from text or URLs.
- `duplicate_finder/` - A utility to identify duplicate files in a directory.

More folders with additional useful code snippets will be added over time.

## PDF Merger

### Description
The `pdf_merger` script allows users to merge multiple PDF files into a single document. This is useful for combining reports, scanned documents, or any other PDFs into a single file. The naming of the input PDFs is important, as they will be merged in alphabetical order. Ensure that the files are named in a way that preserves the desired sequence.

## File Organizer

### Description
The `file_organizer` script automatically sorts files in a given directory into subfolders based on their file extensions. This helps keep directories clean and organized.

## QR Code Generator

### Description
The `qr_generator` script generates QR codes from text or URLs, saving them as image files for easy sharing or printing.

## Duplicate File Finder

### Description
The `duplicate_finder` script scans a directory for duplicate files by comparing file hashes and lists any duplicate files found.
